# Timed Session 1 - Interview Practice

## Overview

This session simulates a technical interview environment with multiple coding problems to be solved within time constraints. The goal is to practice problem-solving under pressure while maintaining code quality and clear communication.

## Session Instructions

### Setup
1. Review the problems list in `problems.md` before starting
2. Set up a timer for the total session duration
3. Have your preferred IDE/editor ready
4. Ensure you have access to basic documentation if needed

### Timing Guidelines
- **Total Session Duration**: 60 minutes
- **Problem Selection**: Choose 2-3 problems based on difficulty
- **Time Allocation**:
  - Easy problems: 15-20 minutes each
  - Medium problems: 20-25 minutes each
  - Hard problems: 25-30 minutes each

### Workflow
1. **Problem Selection** (5 minutes)
   - Review available problems
   - Select 2-3 problems based on your target difficulty
   - Consider time constraints when choosing

2. **Implementation Phase** (45-50 minutes)
   - Start with easier problems to build confidence
   - Think aloud as you would in an interview
   - Write clean, readable code with proper variable names
   - Test your solution with the provided examples
   - Move to next problem if stuck for more than allocated time

3. **Review Phase** (5-10 minutes)
   - Quickly review your solutions
   - Note any bugs or improvements
   - Reflect on your approach and time management

### Best Practices
- **Communication**: Explain your thought process out loud
- **Clarification**: Ask clarifying questions about problem requirements
- **Edge Cases**: Consider and discuss edge cases
- **Optimization**: Discuss time and space complexity
- **Testing**: Walk through examples to verify correctness

### Success Criteria
- Complete at least 2 problems within the time limit
- Write syntactically correct code
- Explain your approach clearly
- Handle basic edge cases
- Maintain composure under time pressure

## Post-Session Reflection

After completing the session, consider:
- Which problems were most challenging?
- How was your time management?
- What concepts need more practice?
- How did you handle the pressure?
- What would you do differently next time?

## Tips for Improvement
- Practice explaining your thought process aloud
- Work on recognizing common patterns quickly
- Improve typing speed and IDE proficiency
- Study time complexity analysis
- Practice with a variety of problem types
