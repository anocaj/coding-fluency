## What Went Well ✅

### Planning Phase
- [x] Did I understand the problem correctly on first read? 
   yes. I could have thought of the min_suffix from the get go
- [x] Was my initial approach sound?
   partially its still difficult to wrapp my head around later insteances once the min character was found.
- [x] Did I identify the key patterns/algorithms needed?


**What worked:**
- [List specific things that went smoothly during planning]
- [Any insights that came quickly]
- [Good decisions made early on]

### Implementation Phase
- [ ] Did my code match my pseudocode?
- [ ] Were my variable names clear and meaningful?
- [ ] Did I handle edge cases properly?

**What worked:**
- [List aspects of implementation that went well]
- [Any coding techniques that were effective]
- [Good debugging or testing practices used]

## Key Patterns & Techniques 🔑

### Algorithmic Patterns Used
	•	Greedy algorithm
	•	Stack (last-in-first-out)
	•	Precomputed suffix minimums for optimization

### Code Patterns/Techniques
	•	Efficient string/stack manipulation
	•	Looping with conditional greedy checks reverse loop for min-suffice
	•	Writing and verifying multiple test cases

### Problem-Solving Insights
	•	Break down operations into atomic steps (push from s → t, pop from t → p)
	•	Always consider remaining possibilities for the greedy choice
	•	Precompute repeated calculations to optimize time complexity
